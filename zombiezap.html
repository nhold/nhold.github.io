title: Zombie Zap

<p>Zombie Zap is a project I am developing with a friend for mobile, it's a shooter game with some repair elements. It's the design of Lynden Nowland who is also doing the art, you can hopefully tell from the screenshot that zombies match specifically to the colours of the guns so that you must manage the gun you have and the zombies coming out which gets pretty hectic when all zombies are out.</p>
