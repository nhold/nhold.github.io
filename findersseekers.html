title: Finders Seekers

<p>Finders Seekers was a challenging project for me because of the word matching required, it's a lot harder than you think! This was developed with Bifrost Studios for Royal Antics. I handled all client interaction, development of the game and release.</p>

<p>At one point the game was released on both the Apple App store and the Google Play store, the game sadly is no longer available as the company who released it took it down, but I am still proud of it.</p>
