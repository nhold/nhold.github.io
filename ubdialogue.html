<p>This is a plugin for Unity I developed to easily write dialogues.</p>


<p>I started the idea from seeing this thread on the Unity forums: <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-node-editor.189230">simple node editor</a> and used it as a 
jumping board to write my own dialogue editor.</p>

<p>The plugin also comes with a simple to use API to facilitate usage of it, you simply call void GetNextConnections(out List<DialogueNode> connections) and handle the choices if there are any or just display the first next text.</p>
