    <center><h3>SFMLPlus</h3></center>
      <p>SFMLP is a module developed on top of SFML in C++. It adds the following features:</p>
      
      <p><h4>Transform Heirarchy</h4></p>

      <p>The way most SFML games handle heirarchy is to combine the render order and the transform heirarchy, I have developed my module such that they are seperated. Therefore you can have children of a transform where the sprite is rendered on top of the parent.</p>

    <p><h4>Render System with Culling, Named Layers and Depth</h4></p>

      <p>Depth isn't built into SFML and the Z-Buffer doesn't work too well for it so I implemented a two step sorting algorithm using named layers and sorting depth to get the final render order. On top of that it has a culling system which can be easily extended to cull in different ways (The default is just a simple quadtree).</p>

      <p><h4>Copies SFML Code Guidelines</h4></p>

      <p>This project keeps to SFML code guidelines to keep it consistent for users of SFML.</p>
