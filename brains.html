<p>Brains is the project I developed as my game at QANTM College where I was educated on game design and development. I was the project manager and one of the coders on the project. We were a three person team and won best game out of that years games.</p>

<p>The game is written in C++ using Ogre3D for rendering and our own calculations for collisions and AI.</p>
