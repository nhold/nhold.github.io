title: Valkyrie
---
<p>Valkyrie was a project I developed while working for Bifrost Studios, it took 9 months from start to finish and at the start and 
  end I was the project manager and lead programmer. It took all of my skill to get the game out in it's current form but it went through 
  around 10 different iterations and prototypes</p>
  
<p>The team consisted of 4 Artists, 2 Designers, 4 Programmers to get the game to completion. It may not run on latest hardware (It was released years ago). Please check it out
  in the following video:
